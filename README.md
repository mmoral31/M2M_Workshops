# M2M_Workshops

### Workshop 1: Fundamentals of Computing in a Unix Environment (03/05/24)
For today's workshop, we'll be using annotated accessibility peaks from scATAC-seq data of human embryoid bodies (EBs)\
The structure of the file:\
**Column 1:** ID\
**Column 2:** Chromosome\
**Column 3:** Start Position\
**Column 4:** Stop Position\
**Column 8:** Regional Annotation (Promoter, Exonic, Intronic, Intergenic)\
**Column 10:** Distance to Transcription Start Site (TSS)\
**Column 16:** Nearest Gene\
**Column 18:** Gene Type for Nearest Gene (e.g. protein-coding)\


### Workshop 3: Best Practices for Data Storage and Management
For today's workshop, we'll be using a series of FASTQ files to demonstrate compression and file transfer
